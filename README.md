# Automated Social Media Post Scheduler

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Post Creation**: Users can create a post with specified content and a future scheduled timestamp.

- **Post Tracking**: Retrieve individual post data using its unique identifier.
- **Post Counter**: Maintain and fetch the total number of scheduled posts.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Oracle Integration**: Integrate off-chain bots or oracles to auto-trigger the post at scheduled times.
- **Multi-platform Support**: Extend support for platform-specific tagging (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn).
- **User Authentication**: Add wallet-based authentication for post ownership.
- **Post Editing and Deletion**: Allow users to modify or cancel scheduled posts before they are marked as posted.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide users with insights and performance metrics post-scheduling.
