## 📝 Project Description

A decentralized smart contract built using the Soroban SDK that allows users to create, schedule, and track the status of social media posts. The contract ensures that post scheduling is tamper-proof and auditable on-chain.

- **Post Counter**: Maintain and fetch the total number of scheduled posts.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Multi-platform Support**: Extend support for platform-specific tagging (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn).
- **User Authentication**: Add wallet-based authentication for post ownership.
- **Post Editing and Deletion**: Allow users to modify or cancel scheduled posts before they are marked as posted.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide users with insights and performance metrics post-scheduling.
